Rock Paper Scissors Game

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. The game is designed to be played entirely in the console.

Project Overview

This project is part of my learning/refreshment journey with The Odin Project. It serves as a practical exercise to refresh and enhance my problem-solving skills through coding. The goal is to implement a simple game that allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

Game Rules

The rules of Rock Paper Scissors are straightforward:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

If both the player and the computer choose the same item, the round is a tie.

Features

- The game is entirely console-based, making use of JavaScript for logic and user input/output.
- Users can enter their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) directly into the console.
- The computer generates a random choice for its move.
- Results of each round (win, lose, or tie) are displayed in the console.

How to Play

To play the game:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
3. Open the browser console (usually `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
4. Follow the prompts in the console to enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
5. See the results of each round displayed in the console.

Development

- JavaScript is used to implement the game logic.
- This project serves as a practice session to reinforce problem-solving skills in JavaScript.
- Testing is done directly in the console to ensure the game functions correctly.

Credits

- This project is inspired by The Odin Project's curriculum and aims to meet the requirements set forth in their JavaScript Foundations module.
